# DeepLearning In Unity3D Labs
This project is based in Unity3D, where an intelligent agent is trained to navigate and interact within different laboratory environments using a Multi Layer Perceptron type Neural Network.

The architecture of the neural network, along with the specifics of the labs, form the core of this project.
